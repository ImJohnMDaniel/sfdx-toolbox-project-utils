Two types of scope:
    - Scopes that progressively build on each other -- DEV is a subset of a full CI
        - CI probably shouldn't be a scope.  It represents every step. 
        - DEV is DEVELOPER_SETUP 
        - "Progressive Build" scopes always execute every "exclusive scope" build step 
        - If CI is everything, then should the scope be set everywhere? ....should a scope be mandatory?
            - if it is mandatory, then the validation stage should verify that everything is ready.
        - the default scope should be DEV and you can override the scope on the various stage builds in a CI scenario
    - Scopes that are exclusive -- DATALOAD only runs build steps with a scope of "DATALOAD"
