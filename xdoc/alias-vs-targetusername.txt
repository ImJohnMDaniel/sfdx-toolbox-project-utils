Thoughts on alias verses targetusername



toolbox:project:build
    - The toolbox:project:build command requires an alias.  
    - There is no use case where it would not be required.

Stages
toolbox:project:stage:validation
    - performs basic checks on project to ensure that everything is in order for the build
        - verifies that the sfdx-project.json "plugins.toolbox.project" JSON structure is valid.
    - Neither the alias nor the targetusername are needed in this step.
toolbox:project:stage:initialization
    - performs the following key tasks:
        - deletes scratch org previously created ***FOR THE ALIAS SPECIFIED***
        - creates new scratch org ***FOR THE ALIAS SPECIFIED***
        - incidental build steps ***FOR THE USERNAMED ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALIAS***
    - The targetusername flag is problematic because the deleted org will be a different username 
            than the org created.
    - Requires SETALIAS flag
toolbox:project:stage:processresources
    - performs the following key tasks:
        - deployment of all dependent packages
        - incidental build steps ***FOR THE USERNAMED ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALIAS***
    - Requires a TARGETUSERNAME flag 
    - toolbox:project:build should transfer the "alias" to the command as the "targetusername"
toolbox:project:stage:compilation
    - performs the following key tasks:
        - deployment of project source code
        - incidental build steps ***FOR THE USERNAMED ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALIAS***
    - Requires a TARGETUSERNAME flag 
    - toolbox:project:build should transfer the "alias" to the command as the "targetusername"
toolbox:project:stage:test 
    - performs the following key tasks:
        - unit testing
        - static code analysis
        - data loads 
        - incidental build steps ***FOR THE USERNAMED ASSOCIATED WITH THE ALIAS***
    - Requires a TARGETUSERNAME flag 
    - toolbox:project:build should transfer the "alias" to the command as the "targetusername"

Since one use case calls for multiple simultanous executions of "toolbox:project:build", 
        the command should not rely on the config "defaultusername" setting.
